# <Ron‚Äôs Portfolio>

## Mobile Accessibile Website

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?  
To create a portfolio including my projects from this bootcamp. I also needed to create a CV so this one kills two birds with one stone.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
I needed a place to showcase the projects ive participated in.
- What problem does it solve?
I didn't have a CV or portfolio before and now I can add to this website all of the above.

- What did you learn?
How useful it is to search the internet for assistance on these homework challenges.


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
I relied on a html template from w3schools.com
Afterwards, I updated with my personal info and projects.
Then I deployed to github and launched the url.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
None.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
I used w3schools.com for their template assistance:
https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryit.asp?filename=tryw3css_templates_cv&stacked=h

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
